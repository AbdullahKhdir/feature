Important factors to consider while building an API or a project:

Important factors to make the application runs fast and efficient.

1-How many requests can an application handle on a per second basis?
2-What are the specs of the machine that the node application is running on?
3-Is the application running on a single process on a single thread with one event loop?
4-Is the application clustered?
5-What middleware is the application running for the application's http server?
6-What kind of security and authentication is implemented?
7-How heavy is the business logic?
8-How much blocking code (synchronic code) is running inside the application?
9-Is the application heavily connected to third parties environments?
10-How long does it take to load all those environments (libs), to get data in and out?
11-How fast can the application process a transaction?
12-How many requests per second can an application handle at a bare metal minimum?
